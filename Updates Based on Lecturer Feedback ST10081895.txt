# Updates Based on Lecturer Feedback

## Part 1 Feedback:

### Code Structure and Readability
- Reduced deep nesting in the code for better readability.
- Improved naming conventions for classes, methods, and variables.
- Enhanced commenting for better code documentation and maintainability.

### User Experience
- Introduced more engaging and fun elements to the games.
- Focused on making the application more visually appealing.

## Part 2 Feedback:

### Code Quality and Best Practices
- Implemented consistent commenting for all methods.
- Addressed issues related to exception handling (open catch, throws unmanaged).
- Applied proper naming conventions for classes and user controls.
- Improved the use of the 'var' keyword for variable declarations.
- Ensured the application exits correctly on close.

### Game Design and Engagement
- Enhanced the games to be more dynamic and less basic.
- Improved the overall user interface to be more interactive and enjoyable.

## General Improvements (Part 1 and Part 2):

### Code Refactoring
- Refactored code to improve overall code quality and maintainability.

### User Interface
- Worked on making the application more visually appealing and user-friendly.

### Exiting Application
- Implemented a fix to ensure the application exits correctly upon closure.

## Additional Feedback (Part 3):

### Game Updates
- Enabled the Identifying areas task for the educational games.
- Implemented a user interface for matching call numbers and descriptions.
- Allowed users to answer as many questions as they want to.
- Alternated questions between matching descriptions to call numbers and call numbers to descriptions.
- Added randomness to the selection of items in the columns.
- Implemented a gamification feature to motivate users.

### Technical Requirements
- Stored call numbers and their descriptions in a dictionary for efficient data management.

## Areas for Future Improvement:

### Code Optimization
- Continue optimizing code for better performance, especially in resource-intensive operations.

### Advanced Gamification
- Explore more advanced gamification features to enhance user engagement and motivation.

### Additional Educational Content
- Expand the educational content to cover a broader range of topics within the Dewey Decimal Classification system.

### User Feedback Integration
- Implement a user feedback system to gather insights for continuous improvement.

### Accessibility
- Ensure the application is accessible to users with disabilities, meeting universal design standards.

### Cross-Platform Compatibility
- Consider making the application compatible with a wider range of platforms for increased accessibility.

### Continuous Testing
- Implement continuous testing practices to identify and address any potential bugs or issues promptly.

## Summary:

While significant improvements have been made, there are always opportunities for enhancement. The areas mentioned above provide a roadmap for future iterations, focusing on code optimization, advanced features, educational content expansion, user feedback integration, accessibility, and cross-platform compatibility.
